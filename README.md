- What guests are searching for in Dublin,
- Which inquiries hosts tend to accept.
- What gaps exist between guest demand and host supply
- Any other information that deepens the understanding of the data

The goal is to analyze, understand, visualize, and communicate the demand/supply of the market in Dublin
